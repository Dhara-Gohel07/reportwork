----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To create a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** for your **Tailor Management Software** project, we will break it down into different levels (context level and lower levels like Level 1) and showcase how data flows between different entities, processes, and data stores.

### Context-Level DFD (Level 0):

At the **Context Level**, the **Tailor Management System** (TMS) is represented as a single process. The external entities (users interacting with the system) will be:

1. **Customer**: Provides measurements, receives bills, and interacts with the system.
2. **Admin/Tailor**: Manages customers, adds measurements, creates bills, and manages suit types.

### Processes:

1. **Customer Management**: Handles customer details (adding, updating, deleting).
2. **Measurement Management**: Handles measurements for customers.
3. **Bill Management**: Manages billing, including applying discounts and calculating final payment.
4. **Suit Type Management**: Manages different suit types and their prices.

### Data Stores:

1. **Customer Data Store**: Stores all customer-related information.
2. **Measurement Data Store**: Stores customer measurements.
3. **Bill Data Store**: Stores billing information.
4. **Suit Type Data Store**: Stores different types of suits and their prices.

---

### Level 1 DFD:

This level breaks down the context diagram into subprocesses, where each major function within the system has its own flow:

#### 1. **Customer Management Process**:
- **Input**: Customer provides details (name, phone number, etc.).
- **Output**: Customer data is stored in the **Customer Data Store**.

#### 2. **Measurement Management Process**:
- **Input**: Admin enters measurements for a customer.
- **Output**: Measurements are stored in the **Measurement Data Store**.

#### 3. **Bill Management Process**:
- **Input**: Admin creates a bill for the customer, including suit types and applying discounts.
- **Output**: The bill is stored in the **Bill Data Store** and the customer receives a receipt.

#### 4. **Suit Type Management Process**:
- **Input**: Admin adds new suit types (shirt, pants, etc.).
- **Output**: Suit type data is stored in the **Suit Type Data Store**.
